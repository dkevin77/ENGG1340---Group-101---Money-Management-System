The advancement of technology has shaped nowadays world. With its development being widely accelerated, a lot of innovations have provided eases to human generations. One of many products of technology which has been beneficial is money management system. Conventionally, people kept records of their daily expense on a piece of paper. This could rise problems when people are careless, such as losing the paper record of the expense or spilling something to the paper. Hence, in this project, we aim to create a modern money management system with some additional features which might be more efficient and versatile than the traditional model.
We plan to have the following features in our system (Points with asterisk '*' represent the mandatory requirements from the description):
1*	Allow users to simply add their activity records. This is simply divided into parts (money flow out and money come in).
2*	Provide records’ details such as Date, types/uses, amount.
3*.	Allow users to delete or edit their added records.
4*.	Categorize and present records. (Categorizing might be in terms of dates, types, or account)
5*.	Present statistical reports of monthly activities (account’s percentages to food, transport, entertainment, etc)

6.	Allow users to modify budget settings, i.e. they will get and alert while expenses has just passed the budget. The budget will be renewable and counted on monthly basis.
7.	Currency converters. To make our system be more universal, we will provide more than one currency system for users to put their records in. We might not include all currencies in the world. But we think of some general currencies such as USD, GBP, AUD, EUR, JPY, HKD, KRW, etc. Users will be able to change their preferred currency and all the records will be changed to respective option.
8.	Adding notes to every record inputted. Most of the time, people might forget what their money were used for. In this case, categorizing expenses in general record types such as food, transportation, and entertainment wouldn’t be sufficient. Therefore, we decided to implement a more detailed system in which users might include additional notes to the records. For instance, they might want to type “Valentine’s dinner with my girlfriend at Central” under the food expense.
