Problem statement : (Problem description in general)
One of the most important part of life is money. In everyday life, people use money to do transactions and fulfil their needs. Money acts as a universal measure of goods or services. Its value plays crucial role in humans’ life. Hence, it is obvious that people want to manage their money in the best way they can. This includes a good record system which is readable and efficient. Traditionally, people used piece of papers and pen to record their monetary flows. This might not be the best way since paper is an easily-destructible material. It might get lost or wet easily. Environmental concern also limits such conventional system which uses a lot of paper. 
Problem setting : (Proposed solution & how it works)
Considering such phenomenon, we come with our wealth management system as the solution! Our system utilizes the advancement of technology in the building processes. Your daily money uses records will be stored in much more efficient storage in a computer. It is easy, editable, and doesn’t require any paper. It fits nowadays world where people seek for easiness. Especially for University Students, our management system would easily help them in controlling their money while being far from parents.
Features :
To provide customers with maximal eases, our system comprises several features which are essential in recording their daily uses.
1*	Add a new record (income or expense).

2*	Provide records’ details such as Date, types/uses, amount.

3*.	Allow users to delete or edit their added records.

4*.	Categorize and present records. (Categorizing might be in terms of dates, types, or account)

5*.	Present statistical reports of monthly activities (account’s percentages to food, transport, entertainment, etc)

6.	Allow users to modify budget settings, i.e. they will get and alert while expenses has just passed the budget. The budget will be renewable and counted on monthly basis.
7.	Currency converters. To make our system be more universal, we will provide more than one currency system for users to put their records in. We might not include all currencies in the world. But we think of some general currencies such as USD, GBP, AUD, EUR, JPY, HKD, KRW, etc. Users will be able to change their preferred currency and all the records will be changed to respective option.
8.	Adding notes to every record inputted. Most of the time, people might forget what their money were used for. In this case, categorizing expenses in general record types such as food, transportation, and entertainment wouldn’t be sufficient. Therefore, we decided to implement a more detailed system in which users might include additional notes to the records. For instance, they might want to type “Valentine’s dinner with my girlfriend at Central” under the food expense.
